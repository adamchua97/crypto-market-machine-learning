# Crypto Market Investing Recommender

## Overview:

#### First part of this project is the data collection and preprocessing. Preprocessing the data entails organizing, balancing and categorizing the data into either "surges", which are the points where the cryptocurrency experiences an increase in value, and "pre-cursors", where either the cryptocurrency is at the state before a surge, or it's just plainly not experiencing a surge (also could be decreasing or fluctuating between).

#### Second part utilizes the preprocessed data from the first part and employs various advanced data science and machine learning techniques to classify and predict the surges and precursors. Classification models are also evaluated and compared to determine which ones have the most optimal performance.
